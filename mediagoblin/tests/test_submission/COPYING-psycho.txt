This character design was originally created by Brian Raddatz for the
comic "The Misadventures of Okk":

Put into 3d by Christopher Allan Webber (homepage http://dustycloud.org).
Technically it is not completely the same character.  But it is close
enough to give Brian Raddatz credit, who is an awesome guy.
