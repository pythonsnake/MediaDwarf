(C) 2008 Christopher Allan Webber

This character design was originally created by Brian Raddatz for the
comic "The Misadventures of Okk":
	http://okk.comicgenesis.com/d/20060414.html

Put into 3d by Christopher Allan Webber (homepage http://dustycloud.org).
Technically it is not completely the same character.  But it is close
enough to give Brian Raddatz credit, who is an awesome guy.

Under the permission of both the author of this model and the
character designer, you are free to use this model under the

It basically means you can do whatever you want, as long as you
attribute the original author(s) and share under the same license.

Have fun!
