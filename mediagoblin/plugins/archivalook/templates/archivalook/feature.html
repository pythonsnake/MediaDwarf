  <h2>{% trans %}How does this work?{% endtrans %}</h2>
    <strong><a class="highlight">{% trans %}How to feature media?{% endtrans -%}
    </a></strong>
    <p>
    {% trans %}
      Go to the page of the media entry you want to feature. Copy it's URL and
      then paste it into a new line in the text box above. There should be only
      one url per line. The url that you paste into the text box should be under
      the header describing how prominent a feature it will be (whether Primary,
      Secondary, or Tertiary). Once all of the media that you want to feature are
      inside the text box, click the Submit Query button, and your media should be
      displayed on the front page.
    {% endtrans %}</p>

    <strong><a class="highlight">
        {%- trans %}Is there another way to manage featured media?{% endtrans %}
    </a></strong>
    <p>
    {% trans %}
        Yes. If you would prefer, you may go to the media homepage of the piece
        of media you would like to feature or unfeature and look at the bar to
        the side of the media entry. If the piece of media has not been featured
        yet you should see a button that says "Feature". Press that button and
        the media will be featured as a Primary Feature at the top of the page.
        All other featured media entries will remain as features, but will be
        pushed further down the page.<br /><br />

        If you go to the media homepage of a piece of media that is currently
        featured, you will see the options "Unfeature", "Promote" and "Demote"
        where previously there was the button which said "Feature". Click
        Unfeature and that media entry will no longer be displayed on the
        front page, although you can feature it again at any point. Promote
        moves the featured media higher up on the page and makes it more
        prominent and Demote moves the featured media lower down and makes it
        less prominent.
    {% endtrans %}</p>

    <strong><a class="highlight">{% trans -%}
        What is a Primary Feature? What is a Secondary Feature?{% endtrans -%}
    </a></strong>
    <p>
    {% trans %}
      These categories just describe how prominent a feature will be on your
      front page. Primary Features are placed at the top of the front page and are
      much larger. Next are Secondary Features, which are slightly smaller.
      Tertiary Features make up a grid at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />

      Primary Features also can display longer descriptions than Secondary
      Features, and Secondary Features can display longer descriptions than
      Tertiary Features.{% endtrans %}</p>

    <strong><a class="highlight">
    {% trans %}How to decide what information is displayed when a media entry is
    featured?{% endtrans %}</a></strong>
    <p>
    {% trans %}
      When a media entry is featured, the entry's title, it's thumbnail and a
      portion of its description will be displayed on your website's front page.
      The number of characters displayed varies on the prominence of the feature.
      Primary Features display the first 512 characters of their description,
      Secondary Features display the first 256 characters of their description,
      and Tertiary Features display the first 128 characters of their description.

    <strong><a class="highlight">{% trans -%}
        How to unfeature a piece of media?{% endtrans -%}
    </a></strong>
    <p>
    {% trans %}
      Unfeature a media by removing its line from the above textarea and then
      pressing the Submit Query button.
    {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <strong><a class="highlight">{% trans %}CAUTION:{% endtrans %}</a></strong>
    <p>
    {% trans %}
      When copying and pasting urls into the above text box, be aware that if
      you make a typo, once you press Submit Query, your media entry will NOT be
      featured. Make sure that all your intended Media Entries are featured.
